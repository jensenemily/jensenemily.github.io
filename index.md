I will be joining the faculty in the Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering Department at the **University of Colorado, Boulder**


**About me:** I received a B.S. Degree in Engineering Mathematics & Statistics from UC Berkeley, after which I was a research assistant at Caltech. After receiving my Ph.D. degree in the Electrical & Computer Engineering department at UC Santa Barbara in 2020, I have held postdoctoral appointments at Northeastern University and UC Berkeley. I have received the UC Regentsâ€™ Graduate Fellowship (2016),
the Zonta Amelia Earhart Fellowship (2019), and an honorable mention for the Young Author award at the IFAC Conference on Networked Systems (2022).

My broad research interests include: 

- Control of large scale distributed systems 
- Analysis and control systems with PDE dynamics (distributed parameter systems)

I am interested in applying my work to areas such as:

- Power Systems
- Satellite Constellations
- Soft Robotics

## Current Research Projects:

- Failure-aware control design with application to Power Systems (in collaboration with Siemens)
- Bio-inspired controller design for crawling locomotion (in collaboration with Juncal Arbeleiz) 
- System Level Synthesis for Distributed Parameter Systems


## More about me...

In my spare time I am currently volunteering in Math classrooms at Berkeley High School and volunteering with the Teen Mentorship program for Girls Inc.
