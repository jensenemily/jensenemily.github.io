I will be joining the faculty in the Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering Department at the **University of Colorado, Boulder**


**About me:** I received a B.S. Degree in Engineering Mathematics & Statistics from UC Berkeley, after which I was a research assistant at Caltech. I recieved my Ph.D. degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from UC Santa Barbara in 2020 and have held postdoctoral appointments at Northeastern University and UC Berkeley. I have received the UC Regentsâ€™ Graduate Fellowship (2016),
the Zonta Amelia Earhart Fellowship (2019), and an honorable mention for the Young Author award at the IFAC Conference on Networked Systems (2022).

**I am hiring** students and postdoctoral researchers. Potential **postdocs** should email me with a breif description of their research plan and list of publications; a background in distributed control or optimization is a plus. Interested **students** are encouraged to reach out by email after completing an application to the ECEE department [here](https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/admissions/graduate-admissions); a background in math is a plus, but not required.


**My research** is centered around the analysis and control of spatially-distributed systems. Applications of these systems span the areas from power systems to satellite constellations to bio-inspired soft-robotics. I develop theory to characterize performance bounds, structural properties, and inherent tradeoffs in these systems to guide controller design and system co-design.

## Current Research Projects:

- Failure-aware control design with application to Power Systems (in collaboration with Siemens)
- Bio-inspired controller design for crawling locomotion (in collaboration with Juncal Arbeleiz) 
- Networked controller design with limited communication and sensing (with student Walden Marshall)
