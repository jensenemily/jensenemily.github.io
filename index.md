**I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the EECS department at UC Berkeley**

**About me:** I received a B.S. Degree in Engineering Mathematics & Statistics from the University of California, Berkeley in 2015, after which I was a research assistant in the Department of Computing & Mathematical Sciences at Caltech. I received a Ph.D. degree in the Electrical & Computer Engineering department at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in 2020, where I was advised by Professor Bassam Bamieh and I research focus was in the areas of optimal and distributed control. I am the recipient of the UC Regentsâ€™ Graduate Fellowship (2016), and of
the Zonta Amelia Earhart Fellowship (2019). In 2021, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department at Northeastern University. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am advised by Murat Arcak. 

My research interests include: 

- Distributed Control
- Optimal Control
- Distributed Parameter Systems

I am interested in applying my work to areas such as:

- Power Systems
- Satellite Constellations
- Soft Robotics

## Current Research Projects:

- Failure-aware control design with application to Power Systems (in collaboration with Siemens)
- Bio-inspired controller design for crawling locomotion (in collaboration with Juncal Arbeleiz) 
- System Level Synthesis for Distributed Parameter Systems


## More about me...

In my spare time I am currently volunteering in Math classrooms at Berkeley High School and volunteering with the Teen Mentorship program for Girls Inc.
