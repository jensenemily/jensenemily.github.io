I will be joining the faculty in the Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering Department at the **University of Colorado, Boulder**


**About me:** I received a B.S. Degree in Engineering Mathematics & Statistics from UC Berkeley, after which I was a research assistant at Caltech. I received a Ph.D. degree in the Electrical & Computer Engineering department at UC Santa Barbara in 2020, where I was advised by Professor Bassam Bamieh. I received the UC Regentsâ€™ Graduate Fellowship (2016),
the Zonta Amelia Earhart Fellowship (2019), and an honorable mention for the Young Author award at the IFAC Conference on Networked Systems (2022). I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Murat Arcak's group at UC Berkeley, and previously held a postdoctoral appointment at Northeastern University.

My broad research interests include: 

- Control of large scale distributed systems 
- Analysis and control systems with PDE dynamics (distributed parameter systems)

I am interested in applying my work to areas such as:

- Power Systems
- Satellite Constellations
- Soft Robotics

## Current Research Projects:

- Failure-aware control design with application to Power Systems (in collaboration with Siemens)
- Bio-inspired controller design for crawling locomotion (in collaboration with Juncal Arbeleiz) 
- System Level Synthesis for Distributed Parameter Systems
